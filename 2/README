Xmas is great, every kid loves it.
Often, kids get lots of gifts.
Really, truly happy.

However, sometimes Santa plays little tricks.
Kids need to find out where the Santa placed the gifts (or decode the flag).
Please help the kids to find the gifts.

The clue Santa left is: Sometimes fortune is far from reach but near at __hand__.
